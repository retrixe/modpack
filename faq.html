  <hr />
  <p><strong>Who is this for?</strong> Someone who wants most basic mods but not way too many.</p>

  <p><strong>What Minecraft versions are supported?</strong> 1.16 and 1.17 are being actively updated. 1.14 and 1.15 are not
  getting new or updated mods in this pack anymore, as this is a hobby project and I don't have time to support all
  versions. You may need to update Fabric API for 1.14/1.15 if using your own Fabric Loader. 1.14/1.15 also use
  OptiFine instead of Iris%2BSodium%2Breplacements.</p>

  <p><strong>How to use these mods?</strong> You can check the Controls and the mod menu on how to use most of them.
  For FMap, MobCountMod, Watson and MiniHUD, you will need special keybinds (Y%2BC, P%2BC, L%2BC and H%2BC respectively).</p>

  <p><strong>Is this Fabric or Forge?</strong> Fabric.</p>

  <p><strong>Ok Zoomer has a really weird zoom. How do I get OptiFine style zoom?</strong> I feel you.
  Mods -> Ok Zoomer -> Settings button -> Set Reset to Preset to Classic -> Apply.</p>

  <p><strong>OptiFine and 1.16?</strong> Due to OptiFine being slow and problematic, it has been replaced with Iris%2BSodium
  and replacement mods for capes, zoom, show fps and dynamic lights. A full list of replacement mods can be found at
  <a>https://gist.github.com/LambdAurora/1f6a4a99af374ce500f250c6b42e8754</a> for resource pack features, better grass,
  connected textures, etc. You can also use Canvas instead of Iris%2BSodium if you want. For showing fps, use H%2BC and
  enable fps in the MiniHUD mod, then use H to show it.</p>

  <p><strong>Can I still use OptiFine on 1.16%2B?</strong> Yes, you can download OptiFine and OptiFabric, however it can
  cause conflicts with other mods, hence it's recommended to stick to Iris%2BSodium or Canvas. <strong>There is no reason
  anymore to use OptiFine with this pack apart from some resource pack features and shaders like SEUS PTGI unsupported
  by Iris at the moment.</strong> Make sure to disable Capes, lambDynamicLights, Sodium, Lithium, Hydrogen and Phosphor
  before using OptiFine with my modpack. Please report any incompatibilities to me.</p>

  <p><strong>Full list for 1.16:</strong> ChunkBorders, Chat Macros, Dynamic FPS, EasierChests, Fabric API, Fabric Kotlin,
  FMapOverlayMod, VoxelMap, Hwyla, Capes/lambDynamicLights/Ok Zoomer/Hydrogen/Phosphor/Sodium/Iris, LightOverlay, Lithium,
  M-Tape, MaLiLib, MiniHUD, MobCountMod, ModMenu, MyBrightness, ShulkerBoxTooltip, Splash, ToroHealth, Watson, WorldEditCUI</p>

  <p><strong>What is Architectury/Fabric API/Fabric Kotlin/MaLiLib?</strong> These are mods required by certain mods in the pack,
  e.g. Architectury is needed by LightOverlay. Do not delete them from your mods folder, or Minecraft may fail to load.</p>

  <p><strong>What happens to my existing mods?</strong> The <code>mods</code> folder will be renamed to <code>oldmods</code>.</p>
  
  <!-- TODO: Improve update system by prompting user that they are updating. -->
  <p><strong>Can I update my mods when you update yours?</strong> Yes! If you use 1.16, just click the Install button! This feature
  is only supported if you installed mods via this installer. The Minecraft version and new mods to install is determined by
  <code>modsversion.txt</code>. This file allows you to remove the mods you don't want and still be able to update without
  getting the mod again. If this file doesn't exist, the installer will rename the <code>mods</code> folder instead of updating.</p>

  <p><strong>Why does Minecraft slow down in the background?</strong> This pack comes with the Dynamic FPS mod which limits
  Minecraft to 1fps when it's in the background to reduce CPU and GPU usage considerably. You can remove it if you want.</p>

  <p><strong>Are there any other mods I should consider?</strong> WorldEdit is useful for single-player terrain editing.
  The Command Macros mod allows you to set keybinds to run commands of your choice in-game. You can also use the Rich
  Presence mod which is available at <a>https://github.com/HotLava03/rich-presence-mod/releases</a> to show Minecraft
  in your Discord status, however, make sure you follow the rules of any Discord MC servers you are a member of when
  using this mod. These mods are not included for certain reasons, but they may be of use to you.</p>
