  <hr />
  <p><strong>Fabric or Forge?</strong> Fabric.</p>
  <p><strong>What Minecraft versions are supported?</strong> Currently, 1.16 is being actively updated while 1.15 and 1.14 are not receiving
  any updates, as this is a hobby project and I don't have time to support all versions, so the mods are out of date and some mods may be
  missing in the future. You may need to update Fabric API for 1.14/1.15 if using your own version of Fabric Loader.</p>
  <p><strong>How to use these mods?</strong> You can check the Controls and the mod menu on how to use most of them. For FMap, MobCountMod,
  Watson and MiniHUD, you will need special keybinds (Y%2BC, P%2BC, L%2BC and H%2BC respectively).</p>
  <p><strong>OptiFine and 1.16?</strong> OptiFine is bundled with 1.14 and 1.15, while for 1.16, due to OptiFabric/OptiFine being slow and
  problematic, it has been replaced with Sodium and replacements for capes, zoom, show fps and dynamic lights. A full list of replacement
  mods can be found at <a>https://gist.github.com/LambdAurora/1f6a4a99af374ce500f250c6b42e8754</a> for resource pack features, better
  grass, connected textures, etc. If wanted, you can also replace Sodium with Canvas for reduced performance but more quality settings
  and shader support (not OptiFine shaders though). For showing fps, use H%2BC and enable fps in the MiniHUD mod, then use H to show it.</p>
  <p><strong>Ok Zoomer has a really weird zoom. How do I get OptiFine style zoom?</strong> I feel you.
  Mods -> Ok Zoomer -> Settings button -> Set Reset to Preset to Classic -> Apply.</p>
  <p><strong>Can I still use OptiFine on 1.16.5?</strong> Yes, you can download it from <a>https://optifine.net</a> and
  <a>https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/optifabric</a>, however it can cause conflicts with other mods (the
  original reason OptiFabric was discontinued), hence it's recommended to stick to Sodium/Canvas <i>unless you really
  want shaders, apart from which there's no reason to use OptiFine anymore.</i> Make sure to disable lambDynamicLights,
  Sodium, Lithium, Hydrogen and Phosphor before using OptiFine 1.16 with my modpack. Please report any incompatibilities to me.</p>
  <p><strong>Full list for 1.16:</strong> ChunkBorders, Chat Macros, Dynamic FPS, EasierChests, Fabric API, FMapOverlayMod,
  VoxelMap, Hwyla, (Capes/Hydrogen/lambDynamicLights/Ok Zoomer/Phosphor/Sodium) on 1.16, OptiFine%2BOptiFabric on 1.14/1.15,
  LightOverlay, Lithium, M-Tape, MaLiLib, MiniHUD, MobCountMod, MyBrightness, ShulkerBoxTooltip, Splash,
  ToroHealth, Watson, WorldEditCUI</p>
  <p><strong>What happens to my existing mods?</strong> They will be renamed to <code>oldmodfolder</code>.
  Currently there is a bug that if both <code>mods</code> and <code>oldmodfolder</code> exist, the mods will be duplicated
  in the <code>mods</code> folder. <strong>Hence, make sure your old mods are well clear before installing these mods!</strong></p>
  <p><strong>Can I update my mods when you update yours?</strong> Yes! If you use 1.16, just click the Install button! This feature
  is only supported if you installed mods via this installer. The Minecraft version and new mods to install is determined by
  <code>modsversion.txt</code>. This file allows you to remove the mods you don't want and still be able to update without
  getting the mod again. If this file doesn't exist, the installer will rename the <code>mods</code> folder instead of updating.</p>
  <p><strong>Why does Minecraft slow down in the background?</strong> This pack comes with the Dynamic FPS mod which limits
  Minecraft to 1fps when it's in the background to reduce CPU and GPU usage considerably. You can remove it if you want.</p>
  <p><strong>Who is this for?</strong> Someone who wants most basic mods but not way too many.</p>
  <p><strong>Are there any other mods I should consider?</strong> WorldEdit is useful for single-player terrain editing.
  The Command Macros mod allows you to set keybinds to run commands of your choice in-game. You can also use the Rich
  Presence mod which is available at <a>https://github.com/HotLava03/rich-presence-mod/releases</a> to show Minecraft
  in your Discord status, however, make sure you follow the rules of any Discord MC servers you are a member of when
  using this mod. These mods are not included for certain reasons, but they may be of use to you.</p>
